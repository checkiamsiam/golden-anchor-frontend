                Golden Anchor was founded in 1989 as a small family business with a passion for authentic food from all over the world. Over the
                years, we&apos;ve grown into a leading provider of authentic food to stores and restaurants around the globe.
                <br /> <br /> In the early days, Golden Anchor operated out of a small warehouse in De Zilk, Netherlands. We had a small team of
                employees and a limited product line, but we were passionate about what we did. We traveled the world to source the best ingredients
                and build relationships with local suppliers. <br />
                We quickly gained a reputation for our high-quality products and excellent customer service. Our customers included small ethnic
                grocery stores, restaurants, and catering businesses.
                <br /> <br />
                Today, Golden Anchor is a global company with offices in the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, Portugal, Spain, and Thailand. We
                have a team of over 60 employees and a product line of over 1,000 items. We supply authentic food to stores and restaurants in over 50
                countries around the world. <br />
                We&apos;re still a family business at heart, and we&apos;re still passionate about authentic food. We&apos;re proud to have grown our
                business over the years, but we&apos;ve never lost sight of our original mission: to provide our customers with the best possible
                authentic food experience.
